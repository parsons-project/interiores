Diseño de interiores (Interior design)
==========
This application is intended to design rooms and distribute furniture automatically in an intelligent fashion.
The application is able to generate designs fulfilling a set of constraints, which can be finetuned by the user, such as:

- Restrictions over furniture pieces, such as place, color, price, material, orientation, ...
- Binary restrictions over furniture pieces, such as maximum/minimum distance and facing constraints.
- Global restrictions, such as maximum budget and free room to move.

It features a GUI with real time interaction and an integrated terminal with command support.

This is a school project from the "Programming Projects" subject at the FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics.
